## Background Info to Build Code From

### Picking a case study and finding number of tourists there- no need to figure out env quality according to Plantinga. Just focus on tourists and assign a certain number of damage to each and go for a steady state like the fishery stock problem.

### Case Studies We Can Use
### 1.National Parks Data (have $ spent and guest count) EASIEST BY FAR
### 2.I have lots of data on spending in Galapagos
### 3.Costa Rica also an option
